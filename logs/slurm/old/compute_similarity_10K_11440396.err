=== Graph Quality Analysis ===
2025-08-11 22:41:17,699 - Quality concerns:
2025-08-11 22:41:17,699 - ⚠️  7782 potential hub nodes (>500 neighbors) - might dominate
2025-08-11 22:41:17,699 - ⚠️  High average degree (3091.2) - graph too dense
2025-08-11 22:41:17,699 - 
Consider adjusting threshold (current: 0.9)
2025-08-11 22:41:17,699 - Suggestion: Try threshold=0.95 for fewer connections
